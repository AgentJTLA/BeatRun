BeatRun combines the essential features of a pedometer, such as step tracking and distance counting, with the added integration of a music player. While the user is in motion, BeatRun automatically plays music from their personalized library. When the user stops moving for a while, the music pauses and is replaced by a motivational voice to encourage them toward their goals and milestones. This experience is designed to keep users motivated and in motion, especially when listening to their favorite tracks.
